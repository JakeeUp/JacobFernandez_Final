Thank you for buying and downloading this package. The use is very simple.

- The prefabs can be found in the folder "_Prefabs". 
- All objects have different numbers of simple materials. You can give it your custom color and glowing by simply changing the material color or the HDR color!
- The materials can be found in the folder "_Material".
- The meshes in .fbx format are in the "Meshes" folder.
- In the folder "_Postprocessing" you will find a postprocessing profile "Profile". To use this profile you first need the Unity Assets "Post Processing" in your project. Then you should add the component "Post-process Layer" to your camera.
- In the folder "Terrain" are 3 different terrain layers which fit perfectly for this package.
